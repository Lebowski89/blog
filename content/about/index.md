Hi,

I'm just someone, who, in my sparetime, loves self-hosting the various services I enjoy and depend on, with a specific focus on media-centric apps (i.e, the ‘Servarr-suite’ (Bazarr, Lidarr, Prowlarr, Radarr, Readarr, Sonarr and Whisparr)), which aid in my favourite pastime of media consumption (when I'm not in War Thunder). The purpose of this blog will be to share various tidbits of information and guides from my experiences, especially those pertaining to my current ansible + ubuntu + docker swarm setup.
