## Ansible Lives!

A weird thing I've noticed with my Ansible journey are the number of people who either think that Ansible is dying/dead. It simply is not so. Some of these 'doomsayers' don't approach Ansible with a mindset of what can it do to help them achieve jobs and tasks, they approach it with whether learning it will give them the skill-set to fast-track their entry into a job, career, industry. These people will then jump onto Kubernetes and other solutions that are 'all the rage' these days. But it's important to remember:

1. Ansible is actively supported and developed and in use by users and teams in both a home-lab and professional setting
2. Ansible is not in competition, or incompatible, with most of the other solutions that people try compare it with, and it will typically work well alongside them
3. Ansible will give you what you give it - as in, if you spend the time to construct well-built roles that do what you need them to do, while having a clear goal of what you're setting out to do, Ansible will save you much time and frustration.

For me, I'm just a home-labber hobbyist using Ansible as a tool to set up my local servers and docker swarm stacks. I enjoy Ansible, I enjoy docker swarm. It's what I like, it's what spins up all my desired containers/services.
