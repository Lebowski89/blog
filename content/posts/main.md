title: Welcome to my Blog
---

This blog is dedicated to Ansible, and I will use this to discuss my set-up, and hopefully provide some useful tips and information from my experiences using Ansible to set-up and deploy my Docker containers and Swarm services.

My motivation behind this blog is that since I started using Ansible, I have grown to love it and am quite addicted to it, but it can be quite daunting for newcomers, and it is one thing to automate a task and another to do it efficiently and effectively. It can be easy to fall into a rabbit hole of troubleshooting, frustration, and even... dispair. So with that said, see the menus above for my topics on Ansible. It will grow over time when I have time.


**Disclaimers:**

  - I’m not some IT-guru with 50 years industry experience. This is my hobby and I know enough to get the tasks I need done and that’s it.
  - Anything written will be from the point of view of someone relying primarily on Debian-based OSs. You can use Ansible to handle Windows, but I don't do it.
  - This blog is written as much for me as it is for anyone else, in a sense, much of it is about me providing a rationale of what I am doing, and why I am doing it, with a touch of tips, opinions, rants, and whatever else has come to my mind.
  - My setup and how I use tools like ansible is simply how I choose to approach it. Yours may differ, and that’s okay.
