Hi,

I'm just an Aussie with degrees in marine science, who, in my sparetime, loves self-hosting the various services I enjoy and depend on, with a specific focus on media-centric apps (i.e, the ‘Servarr-suite’ (Bazarr, Lidarr, Prowlarr, Radarr, Readarr, Sonarr and Whisparr)), which aid in my other favourite pastime of media consumption (when I'm not in War Thunder). 

The purpose of this blog will be to share various tidbits of information and guides from my experiences, especially those pertaining to my current ansible + docker swarm setup. 

**Disclaimers:**

  - I’m not some IT-guru with 50 years industry experience. This is my hobby and I know enough to get the tasks I need done and that’s it.
  - This blog is written as much for me as it is for anyone else, in a sense, much of it is about me providing a rationale of what I am doing, and why I am doing it, with a touch of tips, opinions, rants, and whatever else has come to my mind.
  - My setup and how I use tools like ansible is simply how I choose to approach it. Yours may differ, and that’s okay.
